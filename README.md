# SDEV140-Final-Project-HPruett
Hannah Pruett SDEV140 Final Project Outline and Notes:

Complete:
I used MO6 Assn2 to work on the beginning steps of my GUI project. 
I have a working tkinter file with 2 windows
I am using a modular approach- I already have 1 working function
I have 2/3 labels
I have 3/3 buttons
I have an 1/3 call back function buttons
I have commented my code already and will continue as I work on my GUI

Next Steps/I need: 
1 more label
2 more call back function buttons
Input validation
2 images
User manual

Problems: 
I had issues learning how to make the windows look astetically pleasing. I used the pack.pady= function to make pretty space around labels, buttons, and entry boxes.
